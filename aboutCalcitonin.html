<h3>About</h3>
<p>
The puropse of this wab page is to keep track of which nostril to use for taking Calcitonin and to keep track of the doses.<br>
The first time the page is run for a new spray bottle, you'll have to select the start date (defaults to the current date)<br>
and which nostril to use, then save the information.  The web page will save this in local storage.<br>
Afterwards, the web page will assume the Calcitonin was taken daily and display the nostril to use and the total doses.<br>
If it is desired to skip a day in the middle of a spray bottle, select the skip button then press the "record skip day" button.<br>
This will increment the days skipped and keep the doses since start from incrementing.
